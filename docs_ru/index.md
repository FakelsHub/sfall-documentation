sfall is a set of engine modifications for the classic game Fallout 2 in form of a DLL, which modifies executable in memory without changing anything in EXE file itself.

Engine modifications include:

* Better support for modern operating systems
* Externalizing many settings like starting map and game time, skills, perks, critical hit tables, books, etc.
* Bug fixes
* Many additional features for users, such as item highlight button, party member control, etc.
* Extended scripting capabilities for modders (many new opcodes to control sfall features as well as previously unavailable vanilla engine functions)

## Getting started

This is documentation for sfall specifically, not Fallout scripting in general. For vanilla function reference, refer to the [wiki](https://falloutmods.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_1_and_Fallout_2_scripting_-_commands,_reference,_tutorials).

To get started with sfall, first familiarize yourself with new concepts:
* [Global scripts](global-scripts/)
* [Global variables](global-variables/)
* [Arrays](arrays/)
* [Hooks](hooks/)
* [Data types](data-types/)
* [Lists](lists/)

Pay special attention to the [best practices]({{ site.baseurl }}/best-practices/) page.

Next, proceed to discover new functions. They are categorized, use the menu to find the one you need. If you can't, also check [uncategorized functions]({{ site.baseurl }}/other/) list and [sfall macros]({{ site.baseurl }}/sfall-funcx-macros/).
